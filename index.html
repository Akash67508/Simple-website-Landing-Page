     <p style ="" class="title">Disasters strike without warning, disrupting lives and communities with sudden and often catastrophic force. Nature's fury is unleashed in various forms fires raging and devouring homes, earthquakes shaking the very foundations of existence, and floodwaters surging to swallow entire neighborhoods. Hurricanes and tornadoes tear through landscapes, leaving a trail of destruction, while tsunamis bring towering waves that sweep away everything in their path. Volcanic eruptions paint the sky with ash, and droughts parch the earth, withering crops and threatening livelihoods. Avalanches and landslides bury everything beneath tons of debris, and epidemics spread, causing widespread panic and fear.</p>

     <p style="" class="snow">As the winter sun dipped behind the frosted peaks, a lone figure geared up for the descent. Clad in vibrant snow gear that contrasted sharply against the pristine white canvas, he stood poised at the edge of the slope. The air was crisp, filled with the promise of adventure and the faint echo of distant laughter from fellow skiers. With a deep breath, he pushed off, his skis slicing effortlessly through the powder.As the winter sun dipped behind the frosted peaks, a lone figure geared up for the descent.

The air was crisp, filled with the promise of adventure and the faint echo of distant laughter from fellow skiers.

     <img width="600" src="C:\Users\msi\OneDrive\Desktop\pumo html1 project\Img\robert-lamb-5SGZCmLsN0U-unsplash.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Sea">
     <p style="" class="sea">The rhythmic pulse of the ocean waves creates a mesmerizing dance along the shore, where each wave rises with a gentle grace before crashing into a frothy embrace. The sound is a timeless lullaby, a soothing symphony that echoes the heartbeat of the earth itself. As the waves roll in, they carry with them the stories of distant lands, whispers of winds that have traveled across vast expanses of water. Each crest sparkles under the sun's gaze, catching the light and reflecting it in a dazzling array of blues and greens. The waves seem alive, full of energy and intent, as they surge forward, only to retreat in a delicate ballet that has played out for eons. Their relentless motion shapes the shoreline, smoothing rough edges and creating new forms in the sand with every ebb and flow. Standing at the edge of the sea, one feels the power and mystery of the waves—a connection to the deep, unseen forces that govern the tides and, in turn, the rhythm of life itself.</p>

     <p style="" class="mount">Mountains stand as ancient sentinels of the Earth, their towering peaks reaching towards the heavens, cloaked in mystery and majesty. These colossal formations, shaped over millennia by the relentless forces of nature, evoke a sense of awe and wonder in all who gaze upon them. Each mountain is a storybook of geological history, with layers of rock telling tales of ancient seas, volcanic eruptions, and the slow, inexorable movements of tectonic plates. From a distance, they appear serene and unchanging, their rugged silhouettes etched against the sky like the timeless guardians of the land. But up close, mountains reveal a different reality—a landscape of sharp ridges, deep valleys, and weathered cliffs that bear the scars of countless storms and seismic events.</p>
